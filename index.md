## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 1, part 1:
This lab specifically was fun to me for the different ways I was introduced into coding for the first time. That was the importance for the fun was the introduction in coding for myself and being able to do the simple tasks like making a header week 1 to that being a breeze now at the end of the semester. The challenges I faced in week 1 are now easier to deal with and go by over the course of the labs now with experience with those similar issues now when I run into them when coding.

Lab 5, part 2:
This was when I started getting the hang of things and being able to utilize the skills I had before from prior knowledge and can be more engaged and focused on the labs now. My lab partner really had patience with me in part 2 of this lab and taught me my way through this lab and part 2 specifically with the formatting and linting issues. With my lab partners experience in mind, the flow of this lab went well with myself in learning new ways of identifying formatting and linting issues.

Lab 12, part 1:
The last lab of the semester was by far the most challenging for myself and learning the most at the same time with my lab partner being more experienced than me and easier to identify with themselves on the issues with part 1. This lab showed the goodness that comes out of coding and really having fun with the creativity of coming and showing the behind the scenes on everyday images. Part 1 of this lab showed true patience and really puts a different perspective in coding on myself from this part of the lab.
